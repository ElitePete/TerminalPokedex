TPokedex is a terminal-based application using PokeAPIv2 that allows you to search for Pokemon, items, moves, berries, and more. It was made for practice and to showcase skills, as well as for anyone who loves Pokemon and nostalgic games. The fact that it's a terminal app adds to the nostalgia, as it emulates the way the old Pokemon games were played.
